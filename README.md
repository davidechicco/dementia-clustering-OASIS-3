R packages needed: `pacman`, `stringr`, `kml3d`, `dplyr`

Commands to install them in from shell:

`R`

`install.packages("pacman", dependencies = TRUE)`

`library("pacman")`

`p_load("stringr","kml3d", "dplyr")`

Application of the `kml3d` method to the OASIS-3 dataset:

`source(kml3d_oasis3_script.r)`

or

`Rscript kml3d_oasis3_script.r`
